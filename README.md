# MG WPCLI Bashes
I will include in this repository a bunch of useful bashes for my daily WordPress tasks.

## mg-wp-install
This command creates a database, downloads the latest WordPress version in spanish and makes the installation.
**Syntax**
`$ mg-wp-install <project name>`

**WordPress Credentials**
User: _admin_
pass: _admin_
_(it's for development purposes, if you want to change the credentials modify the bash file with your data)_
